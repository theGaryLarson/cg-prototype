# Career Gate

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an inclusive community for IT industry professionals, educators, and learners.
This platform serves as a comprehensive tool for learners to accurately self-assess their skills, pinpoint their
technical strengths and weaknesses, identify professional interests, and spot skills gaps in existing jobs.

Educators play a pivotal role in shaping both the academic journey and career paths of learners. They are equipped to
advise learners on areas needing enhancement while guiding them towards useful resources, contributing insight
especially
valuable to senior students striving to procure employment or expand their experience to bridge any skills gap.
Employers' contributions are equally integral, providing job skill competency matrices that we ingeniously map using the
Lightcast taxonomy. This creates a unique alignment with relevant training and job postings. Transitioning from a
role-centric approach, we place heightened emphasis on finding optimum-fit opportunities for individuals desiring to
make their mark in the IT industry or existing professionals seeking advancement.
By maintaining an unwavering focus on skills, we not only cater to the career aspirations of employees but also serve
employers' interests looking to upscale the capabilities of their current team. Our commitment lies in aligning
individual aptitudes with industry demands, thereby stringing together a mutually beneficial network of learners,
educators, and employers.

Our users include:

- **Students**: Learners seeking to assess their unique skill set, ascertain their strengths and weaknesses, and acquire
  experience by working on industry-standard projects.
- **Educators**: Providers of educational & training material. They help shape the platform, mould
  learners, and highlight promising talent.
- **Employers/Recruiters**: Scouting for fresh talent, aiming to close the skills gap in their team or company, or just
  looking to contribute to the professional growth of budding talent in the industry.
- **Volunteer-Mentors**: Mentors aiming to guide, empower and share professional wisdom with the rising talent in the
  industry.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and start the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine. You can do this by running the
   following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/theGaryLarson/cg-prototype
    ```

2. **Navigate into the cloned directory**: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate into the directory:

    ```bash
    cd cg-prototype
    ```

3. **Install the dependencies**: Install the necessary packages for the project by running:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. **Start the Development Server**: You can start the development server by running:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

   This starts the development server on `localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified). Navigate
   to `http://localhost:3000` (or whichever port you specified) in your browser to see your application running.

5. **Build the Application**: If you want to create an optimized version of the app for deployment, you can create a
   production build by running:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

6. **Start the Production Server**: After creating a build, you can start the production server by running:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```
   If you want to run the production server on a specific port, you can use `npm run start -- -p YourPortNumber`. </br>

7. **Running Tests**: If your application has an associated Jest test suite, you can run the tests by executing:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```
